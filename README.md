# GeoMeasurements
Web application for monitoring and receiving data from environmental sensors

The developed software is a web application created using the Python programming language, Django framework. SQLite is used as the database.
The information system allows you to collect data from various sensors that monitor the environment and display this data on the screen both using interactive map, tables, graphs.

The web application provides a regular user interface and an administrator interface. 
The user can view the data on an interactive map, as well as in tabular form and group, sort and filter the data.

The administrator can control the user accounts of the site, view, delete and modify the data stored in the database.
